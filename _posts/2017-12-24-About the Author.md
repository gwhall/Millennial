I come from the central coast of California, and have spent the past six years in Davis, CA. There, I earned my B.S.-Biology, and worked to establish and manage the ecology lab of Dr. Rachel Vannette. Here is her  (<a href="http://vannettelab.faculty.ucdavis.edu/" target="_blank">research</a>). Working there gave me foundational skills to set up and perform scientific experiments. 
I have been fortunate in being able to travel, and I want to connect people from the countries I have visited. My hope in posting is that people from coffee consumer countries learn better what origin countries are really like (and vice versa). 

Feel free to contact me at any of the posted links.
